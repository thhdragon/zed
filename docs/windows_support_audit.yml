# Windows Support Audit for Zed

audit_date: 2025-07-31

summary:
  Zed's Windows support is functional but not yet production-grade. The following issues and opportunities for improvement were identified through codebase and documentation analysis.

issues:
  - id: win-graphics-1
    title: Vulkan Instability
    description: Vulkan driver issues and lack of robust fallback cause launch failures and rendering bugs on some Windows systems.
    recommendation: Implement GPU/driver detection, offer DirectX/software fallback, and improve error reporting.

  - id: win-build-1
    title: Build Toolchain Complexity
    description: Windows builds require specific Visual Studio components, SDKs, and CMake, leading to frequent build failures.
    recommendation: Automate environment checks, provide setup scripts, and improve diagnostics for missing dependencies.

  - id: win-path-1
    title: Path Length Limitations
    description: Windows path length limits can break builds and dependency resolution.
    recommendation: Proactively check for path length issues and automate enabling long path support.

  - id: win-locale-1
    title: Locale/Encoding Issues
    description: Non-English Windows installations can cause Postgres and other tools to fail due to incompatible locale settings.
    recommendation: Detect locale at startup and prompt for or auto-set compatible settings.

  - id: win-testing-1
    title: Insufficient Windows CI/Test Coverage
    description: Fewer automated tests and less telemetry on Windows lead to undetected regressions.
    recommendation: Expand Windows CI coverage and add more integration/graphics tests.

  - id: win-ui-1
    title: Windows-Specific UI/UX Bugs
    description: Platform-specific issues with input, window management, and DPI scaling.
    recommendation: Audit and fix UI bugs, and gather user feedback for prioritization.

  - id: win-docs-1
    title: Documentation Gaps
    description: Windows-specific troubleshooting and setup steps are not always clear or up-to-date.
    recommendation: Enhance documentation and provide step-by-step guides for common issues.

next_steps:
  - Prioritize Vulkan fallback and error handling improvements.
  - Develop PowerShell setup scripts for environment validation.
  - Expand Windows CI and collect user telemetry on failures.
  - Schedule regular audits of Windows-specific bugs and user feedback.
  - Update documentation as improvements are made.
